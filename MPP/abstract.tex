\begin{abstract}       % subsection 1.1.
  This document outlines my proposal for a project researching the implementation of large-scale data-processing paradigms on multi-core systems.
  The aim is to provide easily-exploited access to the vast number of programmable cores present in modern systems containing \ac{GPUs} and investigate how their usage can be optimised.

  The project should provide a framework that will be of use to researchers and students who have access to a high-performance GPU devices and would benefit from an increase in throughput when processing datasets in a manner that can be suitably parallelised.
  In addition, the project hopes to avoid the disadvantages of similar parallel frameworks that require large amounts of user-intervention to tune execution, and therefore increase the barriers of entry to otherwise obtainable benefits.

These goals concentrate on maximising the performance and usability of a framework that results from evaluation and iteration of optimisations alongside research into existing failings.

The resulting implementation shall aim to verify the hypothesis that there exists use-cases, such as machine-learning algorithms requiring large datasets, that can be efficiently implemented on a highly parallel device whilst remaining programmer-friendly by presenting a collection of simple functions that encapsulate all required complexities.
