\section{Introduction}
  As physical constraints make it increasingly difficult to increase the \ac{IPS} rate of processors by continuing the trend of increasing the clock rate, hardware manufacturers are responding by adding more cores to each \ac{CPU} chip in order to continue providing improvements to total throughput. Unfortunately this technique for increasing the speed that a system can perform computation cannot be utilised fully by traditional sequential programming approaches.

  The increased core count of modern CPUs is still far lower than that found in \ac{GPUs} that traditionally use hundreds or thousands of shader units to perform functions required to render a 3D scene. However thanks to frameworks such as \ac{OpenCL} facilitating the usage of shaders to perform arbitrary tasks specified by simple C code, \ac{GPUs} are highly parallel co-processors designed for high-throughput \ac{SIMD} execution on a vector dataset.
